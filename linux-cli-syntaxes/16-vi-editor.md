## Linux Editors.

There are so many editors which are part of different Linux Operating Systems. Editors like `vi`, `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `emacs` and more are mostly known editors. Among these 90% of the operating systems comes with `vi` editor as default editor.

`vi` is very powerful editor and it comes with much enhanced options in `vim`. Hence, we choose to go with `vim` in our sessions.

## `VIM` Editor.

We can edit the file by and save the changes by following instructions.

`vim file` -> Press `Insert` or `i` -> Make Changes -> Press `ESC` -> Press Colon `:` -> Press `wq` -> Done 

We can come out of file without saving the changes 

`vim file` -> Press `Insert` or `i` -> Make Changes -> Press `ESC` -> Press Colon `:` -> Press `q!`

**NOTE**: There are lot many operations are available, But we are talking which is needed for DevOps prospective. Also later we use windows editors in local laptop as a standard industry practice, So this much knowledge is more than enough.
