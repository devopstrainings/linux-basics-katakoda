1. In windows, we use `\` (backslash) to give the path of a file or a directory but in Unix & Linux we use `/` (forward slash).

2. In Linux, we have a **ROOT DIRECTORY** where the path of any directory start here. A simple forward slash `(/)` is called as a **ROOT DIRECTORY**.

3. In Linux, it is preferred not to give any spaces in file / folder names 

4. In Linux, files / directory names are case sensitive.
