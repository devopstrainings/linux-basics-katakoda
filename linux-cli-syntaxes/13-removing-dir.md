## Removing Directories

To remove a directory we use `rm` command in linux. Removing directories also deletes all the files that the directory holds inside it.

`Syntax: rm -rf <directory>`

`mkdir demo1`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}}

`rm -rf demo1`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}} 

Check the output to see if the directory is deleted or not.

**Note:** Once the files are removed there is no way of retrieving them.
