## Navigate to Directories

To change the working directory from one location to another we use `cd`command

`Syntax: cd <directory>`

`cd /bin`{{execute}}

you will switch to `/bin` directory

`pwd`{{execute}}

you can check your current working directory using `pwd` command

`cd`{{execute}}

simple `cd` command will take you to the home directory of the user

`pwd`{{execute}}

In Linux, we refer the parent directory with `..`, So in case if we want to go to parent path then simply we can go with

`cd ..`{{execute}}

This is very useful often times to navigate within the OS.
