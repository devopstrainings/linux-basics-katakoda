## Linux Editors.

There are so many editors which are part of different Linux Operating Systems. Editors like `vi`, `nano`, `gedit`, `emacs` and more are mostly known editors. Among these 90% of the operating systems comes with `vi` editor as default editor.

`vi` is very powerful editor and it comes with much more options, However we consider to know these options because later we edit the code more with editor installed in desktop. Because

    1. Ideally in organisation we work on local desktop than server directly for editing the code. In realtime we dont directly do modifications on server directly

    2. Later we with automations, where we dont do manual changes on the server directly at all in Lab and as well as in companies

## `VI` Editor.

We can edit the file by and save the changes by following instructions.

`vi file` -> Press `Insert` or `i` -> Make Changes -> Press `ESC` -> Press Colon `:` -> Press `wq` -> Done

We can come out of file without saving the changes

`vi file` -> Press `Insert` or `i` -> Make Changes -> Press `ESC` -> Press Colon `:` -> Press `q!`

**NOTE**: Please do not waste much time in editor options, I agree knowing more is always good, But we have other things to do as well. So please limit with these options in `vi` editor. One fine day you can allocate couple of hours and explore some more options.
