In Linux systems, the `ss` command is used to display socket statistics. It's the recommended modern tool for viewing network connections and listening ports.

The basic usage `ss` without options often shows non-listening active connections.

`ss`{{execute}}
# Typical default output columns might include:
# State    Recv-Q   Send-Q   Local Address:Port   Peer Address:Port
# ESTAB    0        0        192.168.1.100:ssh    192.168.1.50:54321
# ESTAB    0        0        192.168.1.100:43210  93.184.216.34:http

Here are some highly used options and combinations for `ss`:

1.  **`-a` or `--all` (Show all sockets)**
    Displays all sockets, including both listening and non-listening (connected, closed_wait, etc.) sockets.

    `ss -a`{{execute}} # Shows all sockets (listening and connected)

2.  **`-l` or `--listening` (Show listening sockets)**
    Displays only listening sockets.

    `ss -l`{{execute}} # Shows only sockets that are in a listening state

3.  **`-n` or `--numeric` (Show numerical addresses)**
    Displays numerical addresses and port numbers instead of trying to resolve hostnames or service names. This makes the output faster and prevents potential DNS lookup issues. This is a very common option.

    `ss -an`{{execute}} # Shows all sockets with numerical addresses and ports

4.  **`-p` or `--processes` (Show owning process)**
    Displays the PID (Process ID) and the name of the program that owns each socket. This requires root privileges (`sudo`). It's very useful for identifying which process is using a particular connection or listening on a port.

    `sudo ss -ap`{{execute}} # Shows all sockets and the associated program/PID

5.  **Specify Protocol (`-t`, `-u`, `-x`)**
    Filter the output by protocol:
    * `-t`: TCP sockets
    * `-u`: UDP sockets
    * `-x`: Unix domain sockets

    `ss -t`{{execute}} # Show only TCP sockets
    `ss -u`{{execute}} # Show only UDP sockets

6.  **Common Combination: `-tuln`**
    Similar to the popular `netstat` combination, this shows all listening TCP and UDP ports numerically.

    `ss -tuln`{{execute}} # Lists all listening TCP and UDP ports numerically

7.  **Filtering by State**
    `ss` allows powerful filtering based on the state of the connection (e.g., `established`, `syn-sent`, `syn-recv`, `fin-wait-1`, `time-wait`, `closed`, `listen`). You use the `state` keyword.

    `# Show only established TCP connections, numerical`
    `ss -tna state established`{{execute}}

    `# Show only listening TCP ports, numerical, with process info`
    `sudo ss -tlpn state listen`{{execute}}

8.  **`-s` (Summary statistics)**
    Displays summary statistics for each socket family.

    `ss -s`{{execute}} # Shows counts of various socket states

The `ss` command is the modern, efficient replacement for `netstat` for most tasks related to viewing network connections and listening ports, offering flexible filtering and detailed information about sockets.
