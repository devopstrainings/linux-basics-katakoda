In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `df` command is used to report disk space usage for file systems. By default, it shows information for all mounted file systems in 1K-blocks (units of 1024 bytes), which can be hard to read.

The basic usage is simply `df`.

**Basic usage: Displaying disk space (in 1K-blocks):**
Run the `df` command without options.

`df`{{execute}}
# Typical output columns:
# Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
# /dev/sda1       480585312 15101116 465484196   4% /
# tmpfs             3983440        0   3983440   0% /dev/shm
# ... (other file systems)

Here are some highly used options for `df` that make the output more readable or show different information:

1.  **`-h` (Human-readable output)**
    This is the most common option. It displays disk space sizes in powers of 1024, using unit suffixes like `M` (Megabytes), `G` (Gigabytes), `T` (Terabytes), etc., making the output much easier for humans to read.

    `df -h`{{execute}}
    # Output will look like:
    # Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    # /dev/sda1       459G   15G  444G   4% /
    # tmpfs          3.8G     0  3.8G   0% /dev/shm
    # ...

2.  **`-H` (Human-readable output using powers of 1000)**
    Similar to `-h`, but uses powers of 1000 (kB, MB, GB, etc.) instead of 1024. While `-h` is technically more accurate for typical file system block sizes, `-H` aligns with how storage manufacturers often market drive sizes (using powers of 1000).

    `df -H`{{execute}}
    # Output will use MB, GB, etc., based on 1000-byte increments.

3.  **`-T` (Print file system type)**
    Adds a column to the output showing the type of the file system (e.g., `ext4`, `xfs`, `tmpfs`, `vfat`). Useful for understanding what kind of file systems are mounted. Often combined with `-h`.

    `df -hT`{{execute}}
    # Output will include a 'Type' column:
    # Filesystem     Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    # /dev/sda1      ext4      459G   15G  444G   4% /
    # tmpfs          tmpfs    3.8G     0  3.8G   0% /dev/shm
    # ...

4.  **`-i` (Display inode information)**
    Instead of showing disk block usage, the `-i` option shows inode usage (total inodes, used inodes, free inodes, and percentage used). Inodes store information about files (like permissions, ownership, size, location) but not the file data itself. A file system can run out of inodes even if there is still free disk space, preventing new files from being created.

    `df -i`{{execute}}
    # Output will show inode counts:
    # Filesystem       Inodes   IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
    # /dev/sda1      30531584  456789 30074795    2% /
    # tmpfs           1000000       1   999999    1% /dev/shm
    # ...

5.  **Specify a file or directory**
    If you provide a file or directory path as an argument, `df` will only show information for the file system on which that specific file or directory resides.

    `# Show disk space for the root file system`
    `df -h /`{{execute}}

    `# Show disk space for the file system containing the user's home directory`
    `df -h /home`{{execute}} # Assuming /home is on a separate partition/filesystem

The `df` command is indispensable for quickly checking the status of your disk space, and the `-h` option is almost always used for readability. Checking inode usage with `-i` is also important for diagnosing certain disk-related issues.
