In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `wc` command is used to count lines, words, and bytes/characters in text data. By default, when given a file, it outputs three numbers followed by the filename: the number of lines, the number of words, and the number of bytes.

The basic usage is `wc file(s)`.

**Basic usage: Counting lines, words, and bytes:**
Create a sample file and count its lines, words, and bytes.

`echo -e "This is line one.\nThis is line two, with more words." > count_test.txt`{{execute}}
`wc count_test.txt`{{execute}}
# Output format: NUMBER_OF_LINES NUMBER_OF_WORDS NUMBER_OF_BYTES FILENAME
# Example: 2 11 51 count_test.txt

**Counting multiple files:**
When you provide multiple filenames, `wc` shows the counts for each file individually and then provides a grand total line at the end.

`echo "Short file." > short.txt`{{execute}}
`wc short.txt count_test.txt`{{execute}} # Counts for each file and a total

**Piping output to wc:**
`wc` is often used in pipelines to count the output of other commands. When used with piped input, it only prints the counts, as there is no filename associated with the standard input stream.

`# List files and count how many lines the output is (i.e., how many items are listed)`
`ls | wc -l`{{execute}} # Counts lines from ls output

Here are some highly used options for `wc` to get specific counts:

1.  **`-l` (Count Lines)**
    Outputs only the count of lines (newline characters) in the input. This is very frequently used, especially in pipelines.

    `wc -l count_test.txt`{{execute}} # Prints only the line count
    `ls -l | wc -l`{{execute}} # Count files/dirs in long listing

2.  **`-w` (Count Words)**
    Outputs only the count of words in the input. Words are typically defined as sequences of non-whitespace characters separated by whitespace.

    `wc -w count_test.txt`{{execute}} # Prints only the word count

3.  **`-c` (Count Bytes)**
    Outputs only the count of bytes in the input. This is often the same as the number of characters in simple ASCII text files.

    `wc -c count_test.txt`{{execute}} # Prints only the byte count

4.  **`-m` (Count Characters)**
    Outputs only the count of characters in the input. This is particularly useful when dealing with multi-byte character encodings (like UTF-8), where the number of characters might be different from the number of bytes. For simple ASCII text, `-c` and `-m` often give the same result.

    `# Example (conceptual, depends on locale and file encoding):`
    `# echo "你好" > unicode_test.txt`
    `# wc -c unicode_test.txt` # Might print 6 (bytes)
    `# wc -m unicode_test.txt` # Should print 2 (characters)
    `wc -m count_test.txt`{{execute}} # For English text, often same as -c

5.  **`-L` (Print maximum line length)**
    This option prints the length of the longest line in the file. Useful for checking file formatting or potential issues with very long lines.

    `echo -e "Short line.\nA much, much longer line than the first one." > long_line_test.txt`{{execute}}
    `wc -L long_line_test.txt`{{execute}} # Prints the length of the second line

The `wc` command is a simple yet valuable utility for quickly getting basic statistics about text files, especially useful in combination with other commands in pipelines.
