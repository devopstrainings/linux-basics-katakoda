In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `ps` command is used to display information about a selection of the currently running processes.

The basic usage `ps` without options typically shows processes associated with your current terminal session.

`ps`{{execute}}
# Example output (will vary):
#   PID TTY          TIME CMD
#  1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
#  5678 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

Here are some highly used combinations and options for `ps`:

1.  **`ps aux` (BSD style - List all processes)**
    This is a very common way to list all processes running on the system for all users.
    * `a`: show processes for all users
    * `u`: display user-oriented format
    * `x`: show processes without a controlling terminal (useful for daemons)

    `ps aux`{{execute}}
    # Typical columns include:
    # USER     PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    # root       1  0.0  0.1 168844 10104 ?        Ss   May01   0:05 /sbin/init
    # user   12345  0.5  2.0 456789 20123 pts/0    Rs+  14:30   0:15 nano my_file.txt
    # ...

2.  **`ps -ef` (SysV style - List all processes)**
    Another very common way to list all processes.
    * `-e`: select all processes
    * `-f`: display full-format listing

    `ps -ef`{{execute}}
    # Typical columns include:
    # UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
    # root           1       0  0 May01 ?        00:00:05 /sbin/init
    # user       12345    1230  0 14:30 pts/0    00:00:15 nano my_file.txt
    # ... (PPID is Parent Process ID)

3.  **`-u userlist` (Select by user)**
    Show processes owned by a specific user or a comma-separated list of users.

    `# Show processes for the user 'root'`
    `ps -u root`{{execute}}

    `# Show all processes for users 'user1' and 'user2' (SysV style)`
    `ps -ef -u user1,user2`{{execute}}

4.  **`-p pidlist` (Select by PID)**
    Show processes with specific Process IDs (PIDs). You can provide a comma-separated list of PIDs.

    `# Show information for processes with PIDs 1 and 12345`
    `ps -p 1,12345`{{execute}}

5.  **Piping to `grep` (Filter by command name)**
    A very common pattern is to list all processes (`ps aux` or `ps -ef`) and then pipe the output to `grep` to search for processes related to a specific command or service.

    `# List all processes and find the line for the sshd daemon`
    `ps aux | grep sshd`{{execute}}

    `# List all processes (SysV style) and find lines for the 'apache2' web server`
    `ps -ef | grep apache2`{{execute}}
    # Note: The `grep` command itself will often appear in the output of this pipe.

The `ps` command, with its various options and combinations (especially `ps aux` and `ps -ef`), is fundamental for examining the processes running on your system at a given moment, diagnosing issues, and identifying specific processes.
