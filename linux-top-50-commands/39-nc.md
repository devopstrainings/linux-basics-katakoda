In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `nc` command is a versatile tool for working with network connections.

**Mode 1: Client Mode (Connecting to a Host and Port)**
In client mode, you specify a remote host and port, and `nc` attempts to establish a connection. Once connected, anything you type into `nc` is sent over the network to the other side, and anything received from the other side is printed to your screen.

Basic usage: `nc hostname_or_IP_address port`

`# Connect to a web server on port 80 (HTTP)`
`nc example.com 80`{{execute}}
#
# After executing, if the connection is successful, your cursor will usually just wait.
# You could then type an HTTP request manually (e.g., GET / HTTP/1.1) followed by two newlines (press Enter twice).
# The server's response would be printed.
# To exit, typically press Ctrl+C.

**Mode 2: Listen Mode (Acting as a Simple Server)**
In listen mode, `nc` binds to a specified port on the local machine and waits for an incoming connection. Once a connection is received, it behaves like client mode, sending anything you type and printing anything received. The `-l` option is essential for listen mode.

Basic usage: `nc -l -p port` (Note: `-p` is sometimes optional or implied with `-l` depending on the version, but explicitly using `-l -p` is clearest).

`# On one terminal, set up a listener on port 12345`
`nc -l -p 12345`{{execute}}
#
# The command will appear to hang, as it's waiting for a connection.
#
# On another terminal (or another computer), connect to this listener:
`nc localhost 12345`{{execute}} # Use the IP of the listening machine if not localhost
#
# Once connected, typing in either terminal will send text to the other.

Here are some highly used options for `nc`:

1.  **`-l` (Listen)**
    Puts `nc` into listen mode, making it act as a server waiting for a connection on a specified port.

    `nc -l -p 54321`{{execute}} # Listen on TCP port 54321

2.  **`-z` (Zero-I/O mode / Port Scanning)**
    This option tells `nc` to just report whether a connection to a port is possible, without actually sending any data or going into interactive mode. It's useful for quickly scanning whether a port is open. Often used with `-v` for more output.

    `# Scan if port 22 (SSH) is open on localhost`
    `nc -zv localhost 22`{{execute}}

    `# Scan a range of ports (feature varies by nc version)`
    `# nc -zv example.com 80-85`{{execute}}

3.  **`-v` (Verbose)**
    Prints more information about the connection being made or listened on, including error messages. Useful for debugging.

    `nc -v example.com 9999`{{execute}} # Try connecting to a port you expect to be closed to see the verbose error

4.  **`-n` (Numeric)**
    Disables DNS lookups, forcing `nc` to use numerical IP addresses and port numbers. Makes operations faster by avoiding DNS resolution.

    `nc -nv 93.184.216.34 80`{{execute}} # Connect to example.com's IP numerically

5.  **`-u` (UDP)**
    Uses the UDP protocol instead of the default TCP. Useful for testing UDP services.

    `# Set up a simple UDP listener`
    `nc -lu -p 12346`{{execute}} # -l for listen, -u for UDP

    `# Send a UDP packet to the listener`
    `echo "Hello UDP" | nc -u localhost 12346`{{execute}}

The `nc` command is an incredibly versatile tool for networking tasks, especially for testing connectivity, transferring data in simple scenarios, and basic network debugging, by allowing you to easily create and interact with raw TCP or UDP connections.
