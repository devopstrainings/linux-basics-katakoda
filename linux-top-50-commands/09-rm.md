In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `rm` command is used to **Remove** files and directories. It permanently deletes the specified items.

The basic usage is `rm` followed by the name(s) of the file(s) you want to delete.

**Removing a single file:**
Delete the file named 'unwanted_file.txt'.

`touch unwanted_file.txt`{{execute}} # Create a file to remove
`ls`{{execute}} # Verify it exists
`rm unwanted_file.txt`{{execute}}
`ls`{{execute}} # Verify it's gone

**Removing multiple files:**
Delete multiple files by listing their names separated by spaces.

`touch file_to_delete1.txt file_to_delete2.txt`{{execute}} # Create files
`ls`{{execute}} # Verify they exist
`rm file_to_delete1.txt file_to_delete2.txt`{{execute}}
`ls`{{execute}} # Verify they are gone

By default, `rm` **cannot remove directories**. If you try to use `rm` on a directory, you will get an error. To remove directories, you need to use an option.

Here are some highly used options for `rm`:

1.  **`-r` or `-R` (Recursive)**
    This is the option needed to remove directories. The `-r` (or `-R`) option tells `rm` to recursively delete the contents of a directory and then the directory itself. This means it will delete all files and subdirectories within the specified directory. **Using `-r` can be very dangerous if you are not careful about the path you provide.**

    `mkdir directory_to_remove`{{execute}}
    `touch directory_to_remove/file_in_dir.txt`{{execute}}
    `ls -R`{{execute}} # See the directory and its content
    `rm -r directory_to_remove`{{execute}}
    `ls`{{execute}} # Verify the directory is gone

2.  **`-i` (Interactive)**
    The `-i` option prompts you before removing each file. If you use it with `-r`, it will prompt you before entering directories and before deleting each file. This is a **highly recommended** safety measure, especially when deleting multiple files or directories.

    `touch file_i1 file_i2`{{execute}}
    `ls`{{execute}}
    `rm -i file_i1 file_i2`{{execute}} # rm will ask for confirmation for each file

3.  **`-f` (Force)**
    The `-f` option forces the deletion. It ignores non-existent files and suppresses prompts. When used with `-r` (`rm -rf`), it will recursively delete directories and their contents without *any* prompting. **This combination (`rm -rf`) is extremely powerful and dangerous and should be used with the utmost caution, as it can quickly delete large amounts of data irreversibly.**

    `# Create a file that might normally require confirmation (e.g., read-only file)`
    `touch force_delete.txt`{{execute}}
    `chmod 444 force_delete.txt`{{execute}} # Make it read-only
    `ls -l force_delete.txt`{{execute}} # See permissions
    `rm -f force_delete.txt`{{execute}} # rm will delete it without asking

4.  **`-v` (Verbose)**
    The `-v` option tells `rm` to print the name of each file it is removing. This is useful to see exactly what is being deleted, especially when using wildcards or recursive deletion.

    `touch file_v_del1 file_v_del2`{{execute}}
    `rm -v file_v_del1 file_v_del2`{{execute}} # See output for each file deleted

5.  **`rmdir` command (For empty directories)**
    While `rm -r` deletes directories, a safer command for removing *empty* directories is `rmdir`. It will only remove a directory if it contains no files or subdirectories, preventing accidental deletion of directories with contents.

    `mkdir empty_dir_to_remove`{{execute}}
    `ls`{{execute}}
    `rmdir empty_dir_to_remove`{{execute}}
    `ls`{{execute}} # Verify the empty directory is gone

    `mkdir non_empty_dir`{{execute}}
    `touch non_empty_dir/a_file.txt`{{execute}}
    `rmdir non_empty_dir`{{execute}} # This command will fail because the directory is not empty

The `rm` command is essential for cleaning up files, but always double-check the files/directories you are deleting, especially when using `-r` or `-f`. Using `-i` is a good practice for preventing mistakes.
