In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `su` command allows you to switch user identities.

The basic usage is `su [user]`. If you omit `[user]`, it defaults to `root`. When you run it, you will be prompted for the password of the *target user*.

**Basic usage: Switch to root (non-login shell):**
Run `su` without a username. You will be prompted for the root password. If successful, you'll get a new shell session running as root, but with the *environment variables of the original user*.

`su`{{execute}}
#
# You will be prompted:
# Password:
# Enter the root password and press Enter.
# If successful, your prompt might change (e.g., from $ to #), and you are now root.
# Running `whoami` would show 'root'.
# Running `pwd` might still show your original user's home directory.
# The PATH variable might not be set up the same way as a root login.
# To exit this root shell, type `exit`.

**Switch to root (login shell): `su -`**
This is arguably the most common way to use `su` to become root. The hyphen (`-`), or the option `--login` or `-l`, simulates a full login as the target user. This means it will set the environment variables (like HOME and PATH) to that of the target user (root), placing you in their home directory (`/root`) and giving you their standard shell environment.

Basic usage: `su - [user]` (defaults to root if user omitted)

`su -`{{execute}}
#
# You will be prompted for the root password.
# If successful, your prompt will change, and you will be in root's home directory (`/root`).
# Running `whoami` would show 'root'.
# Running `pwd` would likely show '/root'.
# The PATH and other environment variables will be set up for the root user.
# To exit this root login shell, type `exit` or `logout`.

Here are some useful options for `su`:

1.  **`-` or `-l` or `--login` (Simulate login shell)**
    As explained above, this key option provides a clean environment of the target user, mimicking a fresh login.

    `su - another_user`{{execute}} # Switch to 'another_user' with their login environment

2.  **`-c command` or `--command=command` (Execute a single command)**
    Executes a single `command` as the target user and then exits the `su` session immediately, without starting an interactive shell.

    `# Execute the 'whoami' command as root and exit`
    `su -c whoami`{{execute}}
    # You will still be prompted for the root password unless authentication is cached.

    `# List the contents of /root as root`
    `su -c "ls -l /root"`{{execute}} # Requires root password

3.  **`-s shell` or `--shell=shell` (Specify shell)**
    Specifies the shell to run as the target user, instead of the shell defined for that user in `/etc/passwd`.

    `# Switch to root using the /bin/sh shell (instead of root's default /bin/bash or similar)`
    `su -s /bin/sh`{{execute}}

The `su` command is useful for switching user contexts, particularly for becoming root, but requires knowing the target user's password. Using `su -` is the standard way to get a clean root environment. `sudo` is generally preferred for running single commands or granting limited root access without sharing the root password.
