In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `cp` command is used to **Copy** files and directories. You specify the source file(s) or directory and the destination where you want to copy them.

The basic usage is `cp SOURCE DESTINATION`. The destination can be a new file name or a directory.

**Copying a file to a new file in the same directory:**
Copy 'my_document.txt' to a new file named 'my_document_backup.txt' in the current location.

`touch my_document.txt`{{execute}} # Make sure the source file exists
`cp my_document.txt my_document_backup.txt`{{execute}}
`ls`{{execute}} # Verify the new file is created

**Copying a file to a different directory:**
Copy 'my_document.txt' into an existing directory named 'project_alpha'.

`mkdir project_alpha`{{execute}} # Make sure the destination directory exists
`cp my_document.txt project_alpha/`{{execute}}
`ls project_alpha`{{execute}} # Verify the file is copied into the directory

**Copying multiple files to a directory:**
You can copy several source files to a single destination directory by listing the source files followed by the destination directory.

`touch file1.txt file2.txt`{{execute}} # Make sure source files exist
`mkdir target_dir`{{execute}} # Make sure destination exists
`cp file1.txt file2.txt target_dir/`{{execute}}
`ls target_dir`{{execute}} # Verify files are copied

Here are some highly used options for `cp`:

1.  **`-r` or `-R` (Recursive)**
    This is essential for copying directories. By default, `cp` cannot copy directories. The `-r` (or `-R`) option tells `cp` to recursively copy the directory contents, including all files and subdirectories within it, to the destination.

    `mkdir source_dir`{{execute}}
    `touch source_dir/file_in_dir.txt`{{execute}}
    `mkdir destination_dir`{{execute}}
    `cp -r source_dir/ destination_dir/`{{execute}}
    `ls -R destination_dir`{{execute}} # Verify the directory and its contents were copied

2.  **`-i` (Interactive)**
    The `-i` option provides a safeguard. If the destination file already exists, `cp` will prompt you before overwriting it. This prevents accidental data loss.

    `touch overwrite_me.txt`{{execute}} # Create a file to be overwritten
    `echo "New content" > overwrite_me.txt`{{execute}}
    `echo "Original content" > overwrite_me_source.txt`{{execute}}
    `cp -i overwrite_me_source.txt overwrite_me.txt`{{execute}} # cp will ask you before overwriting

3.  **`-f` (Force)**
    The `-f` option does the opposite of `-i`. It forces the copy operation by removing the destination file if it exists, without prompting. Use this with caution, especially in scripts where you want to ensure the copy happens regardless of whether the destination exists.

    `touch force_overwrite.txt`{{execute}}
    `echo "Original content" > force_overwrite.txt`{{execute}}
    `echo "New content" > force_overwrite_source.txt`{{execute}}
    `cp -f force_overwrite_source.txt force_overwrite.txt`{{execute}} # cp will overwrite without asking

4.  **`-v` (Verbose)**
    The `-v` option makes `cp` more talkative. It prints the name of each file or directory as it is being copied. This is helpful for monitoring the progress of large copy operations or when using recursion.

    `mkdir verbose_source`{{execute}}
    `touch verbose_source/file1 verbose_source/file2`{{execute}}
    `mkdir verbose_destination`{{execute}}
    `cp -rv verbose_source/ verbose_destination/`{{execute}} # See output for each item copied

5.  **`-p` (Preserve attributes)**
    The `-p` option preserves the attributes of the source file(s) in the copy, including the owner, group, permissions, and timestamps (access and modification times). Without this option, the copied file will typically have the user executing the command as owner/group, default permissions, and the current time as timestamps.

    `# Create a file with specific permissions and timestamp (example)`
    `touch -t 202312251000 preserve_me.txt`{{execute}}
    `chmod 700 preserve_me.txt`{{execute}}
    `mkdir preserve_dest`{{execute}}
    `cp -p preserve_me.txt preserve_dest/`{{execute}}
    `ls -l preserve_me.txt preserve_dest/preserve_me.txt`{{execute}} # Compare attributes

The `cp` command is fundamental for managing files and directories, and these options provide essential control over the copying process, especially for directories, handling overwrites, monitoring, and preserving metadata.
