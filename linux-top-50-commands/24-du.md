In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the `du` command is used to estimate disk usage of files and directories. It calculates the space used by the contents of directories recursively.

The basic usage is `du [path(s)]`. If no path is given, it defaults to the current directory (`.`). By default, output is often in 1K-blocks.

**Basic usage: Displaying usage for a directory (recursive):**
Create a sample directory structure with files and check its disk usage.

`mkdir dir_a dir_a/subdir_b`{{execute}}
`echo "file1 content" > dir_a/file1.txt`{{execute}}
`echo "file2 content content" > dir_a/subdir_b/file2.txt`{{execute}}
`du dir_a`{{execute}}
# Typical output shows size for subdir_b, then total size for dir_a, in 1K blocks.
# Example:
# 8       dir_a/subdir_b
# 12      dir_a

Here are some highly used options for `du` that control output and behavior:

1.  **`-h` (Human-readable output)**
    This is the most common option. It displays disk space sizes in powers of 1024, using unit suffixes like `K` (Kilobytes), `M` (Megabytes), `G` (Gigabytes), etc., making the output much easier to read.

    `du -h dir_a`{{execute}}
    # Output will look like:
    # 8.0K    dir_a/subdir_b
    # 12K     dir_a

    You can also use `-H` for human-readable output using powers of 1000 (kB, MB, etc.).

2.  **`-s` (Summarize)**
    Instead of listing the usage for every subdirectory, the `-s` option displays only a grand total for each specified argument (file or directory). This is extremely useful when you just want the total size of a directory tree.

    `du -sh dir_a`{{execute}} # Displays only the total size of dir_a in human-readable format

3.  **`-a` (All files)**
    By default, `du` only shows the usage for directories and their subtotals. The `-a` option tells `du` to also display the usage for each individual file it encounters during the recursive scan.

    `du -ha dir_a`{{execute}} # Shows usage for dir_a, subdir_b, file1.txt, and file2.txt

4.  **`-L` (Dereference symbolic links)**
    If a directory or file within the scanned path is a symbolic link, the `-L` option causes `du` to report the disk space used by the *target* file or directory that the link points to, rather than just the small size of the link file itself.

    `# Create a target file and a symbolic link to it`
    `echo "long file content" > target_file.txt`{{execute}}
    `ln -s target_file.txt symlink_to_file`{{execute}}
    `# Check usage of the symlink (default behavior)`
    `du symlink_to_file`{{execute}} # Reports the size of the link itself (usually very small, e.g., 0 or 4)
    `# Check usage with -L`
    `du -L symlink_to_file`{{execute}} # Reports the size of target_file.txt

5.  **`--exclude=PATTERN` (Exclude files/directories)**
    This option allows you to exclude files or directories that match a specified `PATTERN` from the calculation. This is useful for ignoring specific types of files (like cache files or temporary files) when calculating directory sizes.

    `mkdir exclude_test`{{execute}}
    `echo "important" > exclude_test/data.txt`{{execute}}
    `echo "temp" > exclude_test/temp.tmp`{{execute}}
    `echo "cache" > exclude_test/cache_file.dat`{{execute}}
    `# Calculate usage but exclude all files ending in .tmp or .dat`
    `du -sh --exclude=*.tmp --exclude=*.dat exclude_test`{{execute}} # Should report size of only data.txt

The `du` command is essential for understanding where disk space is being used within directories, and its options allow you to customize the output for readability, summarization, and filtering.
