In Linux, the `ip` command is the primary tool for configuring and displaying network parameters.

The basic usage involves specifying an object and usually a command for that object.

**Showing IP Addresses (`ip addr show`):**
This is one of the most frequent uses, equivalent to the older `ifconfig`. It displays addresses, as well as some link information.

`ip addr show`{{execute}}
# Or simply
`ip addr`{{execute}}
# Typical output shows details for each network interface (like lo, eth0, wlan0),
# including its state (UP, LOWER_UP), MAC address (link/ether), and IP addresses (inet, inet6).

**Showing Network Interfaces (`ip link show`):**
Displays information about the network interfaces (the "links"), including their state, MAC addresses, and MTU, but generally less detail about IP addresses than `ip addr show`.

`ip link show`{{execute}}
# Or simply
`ip link`{{execute}}
# Typical output shows each interface with its state and link layer address.

**Showing the Routing Table (`ip route show`):**
Displays the kernel's IP routing table, which determines how network traffic is directed to its destination.

`ip route show`{{execute}}
# Or simply
`ip route`{{execute}}
# Output shows network destinations, gateways, devices, and metrics.
# Example lines:
# default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100
# 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.100 metric 100

Here are some common tasks performed with `ip` using options and commands:

1.  **`ip addr show dev device` (Show address for a specific interface)**
    Limit the output of `ip addr show` to a specific network interface, e.g., `eth0`.

    `ip addr show dev eth0`{{execute}} # Replace 'eth0' with your interface name

2.  **`ip link show device` (Show link info for a specific interface)**
    Limit the output of `ip link show` to a specific interface.

    `ip link show eth0`{{execute}} # Replace 'eth0' with your interface name

3.  **`ip link set device up/down` (Bring an interface up or down)**
    Change the state of a network interface. This often requires root privileges.

    `# Bring the eth0 interface down (deactivate it)`
    `sudo ip link set eth0 down`{{execute}}

    `# Bring the eth0 interface up (activate it)`
    `sudo ip link set eth0 up`{{execute}}

4.  **`ip neigh show` (Show neighbor table / ARP cache)**
    Displays the neighbor table, which contains information about other hosts on the local network that the system has recently communicated with (like an ARP cache for IPv4).

    `ip neigh show`{{execute}} # Displays IP to MAC address mappings for local network hosts

While `ip` has many more capabilities (adding/deleting addresses, routes, manipulating tunnels, etc.), these examples cover the most frequent use cases for viewing network configuration and managing interface states.
